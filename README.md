# ThemeJupyterLab
Creating my own Jupyter Notebook/Lab update friendly theme and other silly frontend extension

<h2>Firstly, what is this repository for: <b>LEARNING</b> </h2>
	- using JupyterLab theme template
	- understanding which files are important and how they work 
	- freshen-up my css workflow 
	- using github via SSH,- command line usage

<h3>JupyterLab Theme extension</h3>

Python package that tells JT here is this bundle of CSS var and styles. Please... work? (said with both hands together in wishfull manner)

I am not gonna modify Jupyter itself, I am not gonna CSS hack even if I wanted to (sign...) because it is not timeless. Nor modifying notebooks or kernels

Just letting JT load my metadata and CSS

<h2>Template itself</h2>

clone it for fucks sake
